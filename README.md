## Overview
Our data science project explores the relationship between the cooking time and rating of a given recipe.

## Introduction
As college students living on campus, finding good food is much harder than it seems. Dining hall meals often fall short, and in the fast-paced quarter system, it can be difficult to find the time to cook. Thus, we find ourself drawn to recipes that are both quick and satisfying. This is why we were excited to explore this dataset: to determine whether shorter cooking times are linked to higher recipe ratings. To do so, we are analyzing two datasets that contain recipes and their ratings from on [food.com](https://www.food.com/) since 2008. Through this project, we hope to better understand how cooking times could affect recipe ratings.

```py 'recipe'```, the first dataset, consist of 83782 rows (83782 unique recipes) and 12 columns, each representing some information on the recipe:
| Column                   | Description |
|:-------------------------|------------:|
| ```py 'name'```          | Recipe name |
| ```py 'id'```            | Recipe ID |
| ```py 'minutes'```       | Minutes to cook recipe |
| ```py 'contributor_id'```| User ID of recipe maker |
| ```py 'submitted'```     |      55 |
| ```py 'tags'```          |      55 |
| ```py 'nutrition'```     |      55 |
| ```py 'n_steps'```       |      55 |
| ```py 'steps'```         |      55 |
| ```py 'description'```   |      55 |
| ```py 'ingredients'```   |      55 |
| ```py 'n_ingredients'``` |      55 |
